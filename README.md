An **Embedded Systems and IoT Enthusiast** who has a fair knowledge of microcontrollers and microprocessors along with basic communication protocols used by the sensors to interact with controller just like we human interact with each other and exchange information. 
 
- üéì &nbsp;I'm a 4th year undergrad studying ECE at @BVP New Delhi.
- üíº &nbsp; I‚Äôm currently working on ARM based Microcontroller.
- ‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp; An enthusiast and a learner, ready to take challanges and complete it.
 

 
 As a recent graduate in Embedded Systems and IoT, I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions to complex challenges. With internship experience at Escorts Kubota Limited and a variety of hands-on projects, I am eager to launch my career in this exciting field.

During my internship at Escorts Kubota Limited, I gained valuable experience working with various communication protocols, including UART, I2C, and SPI. I have also worked on projects using Arduino, ESP32, and STM32 based controllers, as well as BLE and Zigbee along with firmware development, and system integration, working collaboratively with cross-functional teams to deliver successful projects. It provided me with a solid foundation in the practical application of embedded systems and IoT concepts. 

Recently, one of my projects was recognized by STMicroelectronics India at the ST Tech Week Innovation Fair, providing me with a unique opportunity to showcase my prototype to industry professionals and foreign delecates.

In addition to my practical experience, I am also passionate about sharing knowledge with the community. I have created and shared content on Gettobyte, a platform that provides a great networking opportunity. Through this platform, I have been able to connect with other like-minded individuals and expand my knowledge in the field.

Throughout my academic career, I have demonstrated a strong passion for technology and a desire to learn and grow in this field. I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative and impactful projects in the industry.

As a driven and dedicated Embedded System and IoT fresher, I am excited to explore opportunities to further develop my skills and make a meaningful contribution to any team. 

If you are seeking a passionate and innovative individual with hands-on experience in various communication protocols and controllers, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can bring value to your organization.
